# Adventure Game Project

## Overview
This is a text-based adventure game developed as the final project for the Intro to Programming course. The player explores different rooms, makes choices, collects items, and battles a dragon as the final boss. The game demonstrates the use of Python classes, modular design, and basic game logic.

## Project Structure
The game is organized into multiple files for modularity:

- main.py: The entry point of the game. It initializes the player and manages the flow through the chapters.
- player.py: Contains the `Player` class, which tracks the playerâ€™s name, inventory, and health.
- chapter_one.py: The first room where the player finds a key.
- chapter_two.py: The second room where the player chooses between two doors.
- chapter_three.py: The third room where the player finds a health potion.
- chapter_four.py: A trap maze where the player can take damage.
- chapter_five.py: The final room with a dragon boss battle.
- readme.txt: This documentation file.

## How to Run the Game
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.7** installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
